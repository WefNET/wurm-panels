> This is an early beta. Many things do not work correctly.

Installing and running this app gives you a System Tray app that gives you panels for:

- Skills monitoring
- Trade monitoring with categories
- Granger
- Log file monitoring
- Maps! High performance, XYZ maps, with images stored on fast Cloudflare edge CDN
    - User saved layers and features, saved on your computer
    - Features from community map driven data points (deeds, towers, etc.)
    - Feature search
- Settings

To get the logging working across multiple panels: open the settings screen and select your character "logs" directory.
