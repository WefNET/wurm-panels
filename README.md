# Wurm Panels

By Jackjones, Xanadu

> This is an early beta. Many things do not work correctly.

Installing and running this app gives you a System Tray app that gives you panels for:

- Skills monitoring
- Trade monitoring with categories
- Granger
- Log file monitoring
- Maps with user saved layers and points
- Maps features from community map driven data points (deeds, towers, etc.)
- Map feature search

- Settings

To get the logging working across multiple panels: open the settings screen and select your character "logs" directory.
