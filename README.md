# Wurm Panels

By Jackjones, Xanadu

> This is an early beta. Many things do not work correctly.

Installing and running this app gives you a System Tray app that gives you panels for:

- Skills monitoring
- Trade monitoring with categories
- Granger
- Log file monitoring
- Maps with user saved layers and points

- Settings

To get the logging working, please select your player "logs" directory.
